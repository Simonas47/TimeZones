A code from 24 hour hackathon with the given theme - "TIME"

The website allows to choose a timezone in 2 different interactive formats: Map and Globe. Once the timezone is picked, the website shows
the current time in that timezone and the time difference between local time and that of the chosen timezone.

! The website does not take take into account the time switches/changes in the countries between Summer and Winter time, e.x. Lithuania.

Simonas (me) focused on CSS/HTML part of the website as well as the logic behind calculating the differences in time.
